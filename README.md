*1. Project Setup*

Create a New Project: Follow the steps in my previous response to create a new Java project with the src/server and src/client source folders.

*2. Running the Server*

Compile and Run:
Right-click on the ChatServer.java file.
Select "Run 'ChatServer'". IntelliJ will compile and run the server.

*3. Running Clients*

Compile and Run Clients:
Right-click on the Client.java file.
Select "Run 'Client'".
Important: In the Run/Debug Configuration dialog, leave the "Program arguments" field empty.
Click "Run".
Repeat this step to create multiple client instances.

*4. Chatting*

Type Messages: Type messages in each client's console window.
Broadcast Messages: The server will broadcast messages to all connected clients.
Quit a Client: Type "/quit" in a client's console window to disconnect that client.
